Application for Animal Observation

Supported:
- Amplifier DAD141.1 and weigh cells / Hauch & Bach (Denmark)


The automated Scale is used to measure the weight of different organisms (animals).
The All-in-One DAD 141.1 is a universal device for any weighing, filling or loss-in-weight operation and for force measurements.
It is switched ON or OFF together with the RFID_Reader. Scales uses the amplifier DAD 141.1
which handles automatic tare and measurement. Amplifier and Scales are
powered by one of the Power_Outputs, usually UA2. Use variable
SCALES_POWER to select the power output.


An efficient application to monitor and control animal behaviour in wildlife
as well as in laboratory settings

-	Compatible with different RFID systems and triggers
-	Low power consumption and specific data collection lead to long lasting collection periods
-	Applicable world-wide due to its compatibility with different types of radio clock receivers 
-	High observation quality through low disturbance of the animals
-	Data-transfer to external devices, such as personal computers

- Time Synchronization with atomic clock once a day to ensure optimal data quality
- Application Current Control twice a day
- Forecast for Battery-Change implemented
- Energy Bypass so that Date and Time are maintained even when changing battery
- Hyperterminal Output to get real-time data in the field
