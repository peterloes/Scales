# Scales
 designed with MOMO

Application for Animal Observation

Supported:
- Fa.Soemer / Amplifier DAD_141.1 and weigh cells 


The Scales is used to measure the weight of the bird.  It is switched ON or
OFF together with the RFID_Reader. Scales uses the amplifier DAD 141.1
which handles automatic tare and measurement. Amplifier and Scales are
powered by one of the Power_Outputs, usually UA2. Use variable
SCALES_POWER to select the power output.


An efficient application to monitor and control animal behaviour in wildlife
as well as in laboratory settings

-	Being compatible with different RFID systems and triggers
-	Low power consumption and specific data collection leading to long lasting collection periods
-	Being applicable world-wide due to its compatibility with different types of radio clock receivers 
-	Increasing the observation quality via decreasing the disturbance to the animals
-	Data-transfer to external devices, such as personal computers
