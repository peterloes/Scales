MOMO (Multifunctional Mainboard to Observe and Manipulate Organisms) 
is an application to automate the recording and manipulation of animal behavior.

This application consists of the following modules:
 - main.c - Initialization code and main execution loop.
 - DMA_ControlBlock.c - Control structures for the DMA channels.
 - Control.c - Sequence Control module.
 - CfgData.c - Handling of configuration data.
 - ExtInt.c - External interrupt handler.
 - AlarmClock.c - Alarm clock and timers facility.
 - DCF77.c - DCF77 Atomic Clock Decoder
 - clock.c - An implementation of the POSIX time() function.
 - LightBarrier.c - Interrupt logic for the two light barriers,
   enables the RFID reader.
 - RFID.c - RFID reader to receive transponder IDs.
 - BatteryMon.c - Battery monitor, periodically reads the state of the
   battery via the SMBus.
 - LEUART.c - The Low-Energy UART can be used as monitoring and debugging
   connection to a host computer.
 - microsd.c - Together with the files "diskio.c" and "ff.c", this module
   provides an implementation of a FAT file system on the @ref ss8.
 - Logging.c - Logging facility to send messages to the LEUART and store
   them into a file on the SD-Card.
 - PowerFail.c - Handler to switch off all loads in case of Power Fail.
