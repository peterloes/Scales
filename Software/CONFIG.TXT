#  IMPORTANT NOTE: All time values must be specified in STANDARD time,  #
#                  i.e. MEZ!  If DCF77 time is MESZ (daylight saving    #
#                  time), they will automatically converted to MESZ.    #
#                                                                       #

# Configuration Variables in config.txt:


# RFID_TYPE [SR, LR]
#   RFID reader device type: SR is Short Range reader, LR is Long Range reader.
#   If no type is specified (i.e. the variable is #-commented), the associated
#   logic will not be activated.

# RFID_POWER [UA1, UA2]


#   RFID reader power source, must be set to UA1 or UA2.
#   If no value is specified (i.e. the variable is #-commented), the associated
#   logic will not be activated.

# RFID_ABSENT_DETECT_TIMEOUT [s]
#   An RFID reader regularly re-sends the ID, as long as the transponder can be
#   received.  This is used to retrigger a "still present" timer.  The value

#   specifies the time in seconds, after which the transponder is treated as
#   "absent" when its ID could not be received again.
#   A value of 0 disables the absent logic.  This is useful for "fly thru"
#   designs, e.g. with the Smart Nest Box.

# SCALES_POWER [UA1, UA2]
#   Power source for Scales, must be set to UA1 or UA2.
#   If no value is specified (i.e. the variable is #-commented), the associated
#   logic will not be activated.

# SCALES_CFG_XX
#   Configuration values for the scales amplifier DAD 141.1, see reference
#   manual "Handbuch DAD 141.1".  Currently the following parameters are
#   supported:
#   TW - Tare Weight: Value in gram [g] measurements must not exceed during
#        automatic taring.  This is a "window value", i.e. measurement must
#        not exceed ±TW/2.
#   TI - Tare Interval: Duration in [ms] to build a new tare value.
#   NR - Nominal silence (Ruhe): Value in [g] measurement must be stable to be
#   	 valid.
#   NT - Nominal silence Time: Duration in [ms] measurement must be stable to
#	 be valid.
#   SD - Start Delay: Duration in [ms] before real measurement starts.
#   MT - Measure Time: Duration in [ms] measuring is performed to build a mean
#        value.
#   TL - Trigger Level: Value in gram [g] the cyclic measurement must exceed to
#        trigger a measurement that is reported.  See diagram in 10.13.6


# ON_TIME_1, OFF_TIME_1 [hour:min] MEZ
#   These variable determine the on and off time of the whole unit.
#   When it is in the off state, RFID Reader and Scale is switched off
.
